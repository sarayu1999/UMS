<section class="facilities">
    <h1>Our facilities</h1>
<p>University facilities are the basic hardware when it comes to university research, education, and academic activities. It is also a spatial background in which various functions, such as university’s main education, research, and student’s rest, are performed. It has already been verified through many previous studies that these university facilities, just like other educational facilities, perform a great influence on the quality of education provided in the university.</p>

        <h3>World class library</h3>
        <p> Library management system allows the librarian to maintain library resources in a more operative manner that will help to save their time. It is also convenient for the librarian to manage the process of books allotting and making payment. Library management system is also useful for students as well as a librarian to keep the constant track of the availability of all books in a store. </p>
</div>
<div class="facilities-col">
   <img src="/images/cafeteria.png">
   <h3>Tasty and Healthy Food</h3>
   <p> Instead of table service, there are food-serving counters/stalls or booths, either in a line or allowing arbitrary walking paths. Customers take the food that they desire as they walk along, placing it on a tray. In addition, there are often stations where customers order food, particularly items such as hamburgers or tacos which must be served hot and can be immediately prepared with little waiting. Alternatively, the patron is given a number and the item is brought to their table. For some food items and drinks, such as sodas, water, or the like, customers collect an empty container, pay at the check-out, and fill the container after the check-out. Free unlimited second servings are often allowed under this system. </p>
</div>
<div class="facilities-col">
   <img src="/images/PlayGround.jpg">
   <h3>Largest Play Ground</h3>
   <p>  Playgrounds provide the opportunity for students to practice skills that will ultimately play a role in adult competencies such as the ability to collaborate with others, develop decision making skills, and successfully take on leadership roles, persevere in the face of distractions, and generate creative ideas. </p>

                    <p>  I have chosen this course because I wanted to get into organisation and employee development through an HRBP role. If the college adds a business component to the course in the first year for those specialising in IP, then it would be helpful. The college provides a lot of opportunities to grow in the psychology department through extracurricular activities as well. </p>
